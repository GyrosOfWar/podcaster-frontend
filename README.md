# Podcaster-Frontend

A browser frontend for the Podcaster web app. Built with React.js and Bootstrap. The audio player (all the files inside
 the `js/player` directory) is a slightly modified 
version of humanhighway's [react-audio-player](https://github.com/humanhighway/react-audio-player). 

## Setup
Fetch the project with `git clone`, then do `npm install` to fetch all the dependencies. For a dev-server using Webpack, 
do `npm start`. To create a bundled Javascript file, do `npm build`.
